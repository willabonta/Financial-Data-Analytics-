## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

``````{r cars}
smsales1 %>% 
  group_by(Product) %>% 
  summarise(sum(Quantity), sum(Total), mean(cogs))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(smsales1, aes(x= City, y= Quantity, 
                color = Payment)) + #used in adding colors to the DV
geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") #used in chaning color palette 
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
